What is GoldKash?
----------------

GoldKash is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. GoldKash uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. GoldKash Core is the name of the open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.
